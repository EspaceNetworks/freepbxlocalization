"COMMERCIAL MODULE REQUIES A LICENSE FOR IT TO FUNCTION.  Please visit www."
"schmoozecom.com/oss.php.  This Module expands the normal Paging module in "
"\tFreePBX to add the following features:\t\tOutbound Notifications - Enables "
"the ability to notify a group of phone(s) when a user dials a specific "
"number, ie: 911. Any page group can be linked in the outbound routes "
"\tmodule. When a call is placed a page will go out to the page group "
"notifying the page group of what number was failed and what user dialed the "
"number. Any user of the page \tgroup can dial *1 to barge into the call and "
"speak.\tValet Style Paging (Airport Style) - You can now choose to have your "
"pages recorded and when you hang up have it send the audio file to all the "
"devices that are part of the \tpage group. This setting is done on a per "
"page group. You can also tell the system to only use Valet if someone dials "
"the page group and it is in use already.\tPrepend Recording - You can now "
"have the page group weather normal or valet style play a recorded message to "
"all participants of the page group before the pager can start \tspeaking."
"\tScheduled Pages - You can now define custom schedules to have the system "
"page a group of devices and play a recording. This is a great replacement "
"for school bell systems or lunch break buzzers."
