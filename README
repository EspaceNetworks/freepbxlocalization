README - Updated on February 24th, 2014

TODO: Check on whether there needs to be an update from POT files on old
translations. Some of those guys are really OLD and use strings that don't
exist in the current UI, or are also likely missing current new strings that
do.

TODO: Write a script to place the files in the appropriate directories.
update_xlation.sh will probably help.

===ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY==

This is a repository containing all of the current PO files for FreePBX 2.11.
It's divided by language, rather than by module as has been the norm before.
That means that in the "po" folder, you'll find the 4 character language code
of the supported locale (ex: Japan is ja_JP), and inside that folder are all
of the currently existing PO files. Weblate, our translation management
software, demands that things be shaped this way in order for an automatic
import of all the files to work.

NOTE: Many languages were translated a long, long time ago and are badly out
of date or incomplete. 

You can also find the current POT templates for all modules that support
localization in the "pot" directory. These contain the current complete
list of translate-able strings for each module, and should be updated on a
regular basis as localization bugs get fixed in source code to allow for 
more complete translations.

NOTE AGAIN: .po files aren't worth anything until they've been compiled as
binary .mo files by gettext.
