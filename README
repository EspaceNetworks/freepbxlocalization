README - Updated on February 24th, 2014

TODO: Check on whether there needs to be an update from POT files on old
translations. Some of those guys are really OLD and use strings that don't
exist in the current UI, or are also likely missing current new strings that
do. Apparently one can use msgmerge from gettext for this.

===ABOUT THIS REPOSITORY==

This is a repository containing all of the current PO files for FreePBX 2.11.
It's divided by language, rather than by module as has been the norm before.
That means that in the "po" folder, you'll find the 4 character language code
of the supported locale (ex: Japan is ja_JP), and inside that folder are all
of the currently existing PO files. Weblate, our translation management
software, demands that things be shaped this way in order for an automatic
import of all the files to work.

NOTE: Many languages were translated a long, long time ago and are badly out
of date or incomplete. 

You can also find the current POT templates for all modules that support
localization in the "pot" directory. These contain the current complete
list of translate-able strings for each module, and should be updated on a
regular basis as localization bugs get fixed in source code to allow for 
more complete translations.

NOTE AGAIN: .po files aren't worth anything until they've been compiled as
binary .mo files by gettext.

===ABOUT THE SCRIPTS===
makelangdirs.sh
	This creates the appropriate xx_XX/LC_MESSAGES directory in
	module dirs that already have i18n, meaning they can be
	localized.

update_xlation.sh
	This takes all po files of a specific xx_XX language code,
	compiles them to mo binaries, and places them in the right
	folder in /var/www/html/...

update_i18n_*.sh
	This is a modified version of the script that has been
	under progress for the last few months to scan FreePBX
	code for localizable strings and create POT templates
	to translate from. Hopefully this will be the most recent
	version.
